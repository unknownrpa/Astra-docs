# Working with processes

A process is a robot operation scenario assembled from elements. The process type used is a sequence. A sequence is a process that has the form of a cascade algorithm formed from the elements that are executed sequentially.

To create a new sequence, select the folder where such a sequence will be created on the Project panel and click the "Create Process" button ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/0 (38).png>). In the appeared dialog it is necessary to specify the name of the sequence with the obligatory .ltw extension, the type (Sequence, Diagram or Only code) and the language (C#, Python или JavaScript).

**Attention! Due to different approaches to data typization in C#, Python, and Javascript we do not recommend using different languages in the same project.**&#x20;

After clicking OK, the new sequence will be displayed on the Project panel

and will be opened in a new tab of the Main Workspace.

To open an existing sequence, double-click it on the Project panel and the sequence will be opened as a new bookmark in the Main Workspace.

To close a sequence, simply close its bookmark in the Main Workspace.

To search for project elements, you can use the Search menu of the Project panel.
