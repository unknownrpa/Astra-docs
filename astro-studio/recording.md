# Script recording

To simplify scripting, Astro Studio has a feature for recording user actions. There are three recorders available:

* Web recorder
* Desktop recorder
* Universal recorder

To start recording, select the desired option in the Process menu or in the Record menu of the Actions panel.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2 (9).png>) The "Stop" button completes recording and forms a sequence of recorded elements in the current script.

To delete the action chose it in the list of recorded actions and press the Delete button on the keyboard.&#x20;

Let us use Universal recorder to record a simple sequence:
- Click on Calculator application
- Click "5 x 3 ="
- Click on the result screen

Then pause the recording. Universal recorder has captured all these actions:

Stop the recording and check the sequence created:

Web interactions are recorded in a similar way.
