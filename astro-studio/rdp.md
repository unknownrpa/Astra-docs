# RDP

Robot uses virtual client channels to work with RDP. So, an active working RDP client connection is required to work with Remote Desktop. Also, it is necessary to install the add-on agent on the remote desktop (Astro Remote Agent x64) to interact with RDP.&#x20;

You should select "RDP" in "Connect to application" element settings to interact with the components of remote desktop applications and record user actions.&#x20;

In case of problems with recording user actions on the remote desktop, try starting the remote agent with Administrator rights.
