# Variables and arguments

There are variables in the work of the scripts for storing intermediate data. There is the Variable panel for managing variables.

A variable consists of the following parts:

* Variable name is set according to rules of selected language (C#, Python или JavaScript)&#x20;
* Variable type is a variable data type in selected language
* Comment is a text describing the purpose of a variable (optional)
* Default value is an expression in selected language executed when creating a variable, the result of which will be assigned to the variable at creation (optional)

If you do not specify the default value for a variable, the initial value of the variable will be NULL.

To create a new variable, press the "Create a Variable" button ![](<../.gitbook/assets/1 (62).png>) and enter information about the variable in the window that appears.

For a more convenient selection of a variable type, you can press the "..." button and find the desired one in the Data Types window.

There is a generalized type selection assistant necessary for working with generalized types in the Data Type window.

To delete a variable, you should select a line with it in the table and either click the "Delete the Variable" button ![](../.gitbook/assets/5.png), or press the Delete button.

To edit a variable, double-click on the line, the value of which should be changed.

The type of a variable is an autocomplete value, for example, just type List \<String> and press Enter, and the system itself will bring the type to System. Collections.Generic.List\<System.String>.

Arguments are variables intended for exchange between processes. The difference from a normal variable is the presence of the Direction property, which determines whether an argument can receive and transmit data to the calling process. The property Direction has the following values:

IN – The argument works only for receipt

OUT – The argument works only for transmission

IN\_OUT – Both-way argument

To call a process from another process, you need to drag the called process from the Project panel to the triangle that defines the place of the subprocess call in the script.

To connect to the arguments of the subprocess, you should press ![](<../.gitbook/assets/8 (3).png>) button. In the Assignment column of the opened window you should specify expressions in selected language (C#, Python or JavaScript) or the names of the variables used in the interaction with the subprocess. Once you have finished editing, you can close the window.
