# Mobile devices

The Mobile Devices panel is intended for exploring the interfaces of the mobile devices applications and for helping at formation of templates of search for elements of mobile applications.

To work with Android mobile devices, you need the Android Device Bridge (ADB) application, which is a part of the Android SDK.

To start working, connect your mobile device to your computer and click "Refresh Panels" ![](<../.gitbook/assets/0 (110).png>), then select the connected one in the list of devices and click "Download UI". ![](<../.gitbook/assets/1 (78).png>)

The application tree is displayed on the left side of the panel.

When you click on an element, it will be highlighted in the right part of the panel (mobile device screen), and at the bottom, in the properties panel, a set of its attributes will be displayed.

To update the control tree, you should press the "Load UI" button again. There is a special slider at the bottom of the panel allowing zooming the screen of your mobile device.
