# Working with Code

In order to work with you code you need to use the code editor in Studio

Depending on the syntax you've chosen the code rules will differ. For example in C# code you'll automatically get \_\_debug variable for interactions with built-in debugger. Furthermore there are several special rules:

* While working with C# you will see only class fields and properties in Variables grid;
* While working with Python you will see only variables with "\_" starting names in Variables grid;
* JavaScript doesn't support Watch and Variables;
* Watch grid is compatible with visible variables only.

Code also supports arguments. You can work with Arguments the same ways as in any other process type.

In order to add a breakpoint you should press <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (159).png" alt="" data-size="line"> button. After that you'll get special code string at you caret point. Important! Python and JavaScript debug function got last parameter with gets the breakpoint code number.

To create selectors you may use <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (264).png" alt="" data-size="line"> buttons. To edit a selector, you need to select it's string in the code and press the button.

To work with elements you should drag n drop the element you need into the code after that you'll get code snippet for your element.

In order to call separate process you should drag n drop process file from Project tree into your code.
