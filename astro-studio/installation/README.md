or via the Start menu: Astro -> Astro Studio.

After launching the application, a registration window will appear.

If this window is closed, the studio will also be closed. In order to register, you should click the "Request key" button. The text that appears on the screen should be sent to the vendor at [help@astrorpa.com](mailto:help@astrorpa.com) to receive a license key (a file with the \*.license extension). You should upload the received file to the system by clicking the "Upload the key" button and then specify the received file in the appeared dialog box. If successful, the registration window will close and you will be able to proceed with using the studio.
