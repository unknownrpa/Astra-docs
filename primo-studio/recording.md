# Script recording

To simplify scripting, Astro Studio has a feature for recording user actions. The recording can be performed in two variants:

* Web recording
* Desktop recording

To start recording, select the desired option in the Process menu or in the Record menu of the Actions panel. After clicking the "Record" button, the record control window will appear.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2 (9).png>) The "Stop" button completes recording and forms a sequence of recorded elements in the current script.

To delete the action chose it in the list of recorded actions and press the Delete button on the keyboard.&#x20;

When Web-recording a script, the browser selected in Recorder window opens. The final script will include the following actions:

Initial transition by URL

Mouse-click on a page element (the used element is highlighted by a rectangle with the basic data of the selected element).

Entering text into a page element

![](<../.gitbook/assets/4 (2).png>)

A special element appears for entering text. The end of entering is determined by pressing the Enter key. To cancel the typing, you should press the Escape key.

The desktop script is recorded in a similar way, with the only difference being that it collects text input and clicks of the Windows operating system application elements.
